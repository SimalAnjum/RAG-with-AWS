## 1. Introduction
This project presents a scalable, real-time document question-answering (Q&A) system leveraging AWS services for efficient information retrieval from large document repositories. Our solution is designed for industries requiring rapid access to legal, compliance, and customer support documents.

## 2. Dataset & Use Cases
We will primarily utilize **CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset)**, which is specifically designed for contract understanding, making it relevant for legal and compliance use cases.

### **Performance Metrics**
To demonstrate real-world applications, we will execute actual queries on these datasets and measure retrieval performance using:
- **Exact Match (EM):** Measures whether the retrieved answer is identical to the ground truth.
- **F1 Score:** Evaluates overlap between predicted and actual answers.
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):** Measures ranking quality of retrieved documents.

## 3. System Architecture & Deployment Strategy
Our architecture integrates multiple AWS services:

### **Data Storage and Text Extraction**
- **Amazon S3:** Primary document storage.
- **Amazon Textract:** Extracts text from PDFs and images.

### **Embeddings and Vector Database**
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Converts extracted text into embeddings using pre-trained models.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A vector database enabling efficient similarity searches.

### **LLM Integration and Query Processing**
- **Large Language Model (LLM):** Processes user queries and generates responses.
- **AWS Lambda & API Gateway:** Handles incoming queries and returns responses efficiently.

### **Deployment Considerations**
#### **Primary Plan:** Live deployment using AWS services for real-time scalability.
#### **Fallback Plan (Local Deployment):** If AWS costs are prohibitive, we will use:
- **Local OCR (Tesseract OCR)** instead of Amazon Textract.
- **Self-hosted embeddings** (e.g., SentenceTransformers) instead of SageMaker.
- **Local FAISS or ChromaDB** instead of Pinecone.
- **A Postman API collection or lightweight UI** for testing and demonstrations.

## 4. Setup Instructions
### **Week 1: Requirement Gathering & AWS Setup**
1. **Create an AWS account** (if not already done) and configure billing alerts.
2. **Set up IAM Roles & Permissions**:
   - Attach `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AmazonTextractFullAccess`, and `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` to an IAM role.
3. **Download CUAD Dataset** from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theatticusproject/cuad-qa).
4. **Research Existing Solutions** such as Amazon Bedrock, OpenAIâ€™s GPT, and Haystack.

### **Week 2: S3 Storage & Textract Integration**
1. **Create an S3 bucket** (`legal-document-storage`).
2. **Upload sample legal documents (PDFs) to S3.**
3. **Integrate Amazon Textract** to extract text from PDFs using Boto3.
4. **Automate Textract with AWS Lambda** so that text extraction runs when new documents are uploaded.

## 5. How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SimalAnjum/RAG-with-AWS.git
   cd RAG-WITH-AWS
   pip install boto3
   ```
2. **Set up AWS credentials**:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
3. **Run the text extraction script**:
   ```sh
   python extract_text.py
   ```
4. **Deploy AWS Lambda function** using AWS Console or Terraform.

## 6. Expected Output
- Extracted text from documents stored in JSON format.
- Automatic processing of new uploads in S3 via AWS Lambda.
- Query processing with LLMs to retrieve relevant contract clauses.

## 7. Future Enhancements
- Implement **FAISS vector search** for improved retrieval efficiency.
- Fine-tune LLMs specifically for legal queries.
- Develop a **frontend UI** for better user experience.

This project aims to enhance document retrieval efficiency using LLMs and AWS services, focusing on legal and compliance queries with measurable improvements in retrieval accuracy and latency. A Postman API collection or lightweight UI will be provided for testing and demonstration, ensuring accessibility and usability.
